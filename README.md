# A re-write of the Design Pattern Book

I'm re-writing the _Design Pattern Book_ that I had originally written my senior year using `Flask (Python)` for the backend and `Flask HTML Templates` for the frontend. Originally the backend served all HTML files.

This time around to get more practice with `Svelte/Vite` and also `Ktor` I'm writing the backend in `Kotlin` using ktor and the frontend in `TypeScript` using svelte.

As usual, this README will be updated when I finish this project or get farther along with it.
