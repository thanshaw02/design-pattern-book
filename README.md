# A re-write of the Design Pattern Book

I'm re-writing the _Design Pattern Book_ that I had originally written my senior year using `Flask (Python)` for the backend and `Flask HTML Templates` for the frontend. Originally the backend served all HTML files.

This time around I'm using `React`/`Typescript` for the frontend and `Vert.x`/`Kotlin` for the backend.

# Note

As usual, this README will be updated when I finish this project or get farther along with it.
